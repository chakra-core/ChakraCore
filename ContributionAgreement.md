# Contributor Agreement

All contributors to ChakraCore must digitally sign the below agreement unless their contribution is done on behalf of or licensed to Microsoft and covered by the MIT license in LICENSE.txt

To sign the agreement please submit a commit that adds your name and github username to the bottom of this file.

Anything I contribute to the ChakraCore repository is comprised of one or more of:

2. Existing code from the ChakraCore repository
3. The work of a group of individuals all of whom agree to (and have signed) these terms
4. Third party work licensed under terms that enable it to be incorporated into the ChakraCore project

In the case of option 4 I will discuss this Third Party submission with the ChakraCore core contributors before submitting it.

I agree that all contributions I submit will be included in ChakraCore and licensed under the license in LICENSE.txt.

I surrender any rights that would prevent my contribution from being redistributed and used under the license in LICENSE.txt.

I accept that future users of the ChakraCore including my contributions will not be required to give me any acknowledgement except as a "ChakraCore Project Contributor" as mentioned in LICENSE.txt.

I agree that I will never pursue royalties or patent claims related to any contribution to ChakraCore.

I confirm that I have the right to submit this contribution and it can be redistributed under the license in LICENSE.txt.

I agree that a record of my contribution including comments and my name may be retained and displayed publicly in the ChakraCore repository.

If I make any contributions in the course of my employment, then either:
a) my employer has given my sufficient rights over the work I have done to submit it under the above terms or
b) my employer has agreed to these terms and signed the agreement
