GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed. This version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU
General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, 'this License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the 'GNU GPL' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
'The Library' refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
An 'Application' is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class
defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
A 'Combined Work' is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
was made is also called the 'Linked Version'.
The 'Minimal Corresponding Source' for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application,
and not on the Linked Version.
The 'Corresponding Application Code' for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being
bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers
to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
(other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may
convey a copy of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility
still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file
that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your
choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used
in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained
in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if
you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that
permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified
by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present
on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required
to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent
that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of
the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation
Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding
Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms
of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
for you to choose that version for the Library.

Disclaimers
APPLE DOES NOT PROMISE THAT THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICE OR FEATURE OF THE
SITE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED,
OR THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC RESULTS. THE SITE AND ITS CONTENT
ARE DELIVERED ON AN 'AS-IS' AND 'AS-AVAILABLE' BASIS. ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON
THE SITE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. APPLE CANNOT ENSURE THAT ANY FILES
OR OTHER DATA YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE SITE WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR CONTAMINATION
OR DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. APPLE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. APPLE DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR THE
ACTS, OMISSIONS AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATED
TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND/OR ANY APPLE SERVICES. YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND ANY LINKED SITES. YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST APPLE FOR
DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE SITE OR ANY SUCH
CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

The above disclaimer applies to any damages, liability or injuries caused by any
failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, delay in
operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or
destruction of or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use, whether for breach
of contract, tort, negligence or any other cause of action.

Apple reserves the right to do any of the following, at any time, without notice:
(1) to modify, suspend or terminate operation of or access to the Site, or any
portion of the Site, for any reason; (2) to modify or change the Site, or any
portion of the Site, and any applicable policies or terms; and (3) to interrupt
the operation of the Site, or any portion of the Site, as necessary to perform
routine or non-routine maintenance, error correction, or other changes.

Limitation of Liability
Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Apple be liable to you for any
indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental or punitive damages, including
lost profits, even if Apple has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Apple is found
to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way
connected with your use of the Site or any Content, AppleÃ­s liability shall in
no event exceed the greater of (1) the total of any subscription or similar fees
with respect to any service or feature of or on the Site paid in the six months
prior to the date of the initial claim made against Apple (but not including the
purchase price for any Apple hardware or software products or any AppleCare or
similar support program), or (2) US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow
limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.

Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders,
predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates,
harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in
connection with your use of the Site.

Violation of These Terms of Use
Apple may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity)
if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any
investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact
or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference
with (either intentionally or unintentionally) AppleÃ­s rights or property, or the
rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple's
customers. Apple reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that
Apple deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process
or governmental request. Apple also may disclose your information when Apple
determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including
exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection
purposes.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or communication
by you with Apple through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site,
and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Apple determines
that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with
legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any
such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or
personal safety of Apple, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and
the public.

You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,
terminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site
if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements
or guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree
that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and
unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which
monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any
injunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in
such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple
may have at law or in equity.

You agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,
terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited
to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request
by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material
modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4)
unexpected technical issues or problems.

If Apple does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of
these Terms of Use, Apple will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to
pay, all reasonable attorneysÃ­ fees and costs of such action, in addition to any
other relief granted to Apple. You agree that Apple will not be liable to you or
to any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any
violation of these Terms of Use.

Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site,
including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by
the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws
provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and
federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such
jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if
you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in
the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you
reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year
after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.
Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and
services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or
received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the
prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneysÃ­ fees. In the event of
any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection
with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith,
to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within
a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit
such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved
through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy
available to them under applicable law.

Void Where Prohibited
Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino,
California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various
locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide,
not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered
through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations,
or appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Apple reserves the
right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature,
product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature,
product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to
access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative
and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.

Miscellaneous
You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of
such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any
applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export
laws and regulations.

If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other
tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions
shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with
a valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that
these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use
constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of
the Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings
previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby
superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you
enter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms
of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. AppleÃ­s failure
to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free
for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU
Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a
program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running
the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
you changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice
and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections
of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights
to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to
control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program
or works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
to this License.
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as
a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program
does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications,
and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code,

or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code
or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
2.2. Contributor Grant.
Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants
You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license under intellectual property
rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use,
reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis,
with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of Modifications
made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor
Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor
(or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by that

Notwithstanding Section 2.2 (b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any
code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from
the Contributor Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party
modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the combination of Modifications
made by that Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor
Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code
in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
3. Distribution Obligations.
3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that
alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
additional rights described in Section 3.5.
3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available
in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone
to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via
Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months
after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available
to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by
a third party.
3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting
the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
(a) Third Party Claims
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the
claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor
obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
(b) Contributor APIs
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the legal
file.
(c) Representations.
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above,
Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed
by this License.
3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created
one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if
You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is
available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral
in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a
license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for
the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
for the Covered Code.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
description must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5. Application of this License.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice
in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6. Versions of the License.
6.1. New Versions
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.
6.2. Effect of New Versions
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify
the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
6.3. Derivative Works
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in
order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL",
"MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in
your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ
from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name
of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
7. Disclaimer of warranty
Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis, without warranty
of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties
that the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose
or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered
code is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not
the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
essential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder
except under this disclaimer.
8. Termination
8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
"Participant") alleging that:
such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:
(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty
for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or
(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation
claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1
and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period
specified above. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights
granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked
effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
Modifications made by that Participant.
8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent
where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the
licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
termination.
9. Limitation of liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any
other contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any
of such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages
for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall
not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions
do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,
so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.
10. U.S. government end users
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with
only those rights set forth herein.
11. Miscellaneous
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with
venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible
for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
drafter shall not apply to this License.
12. Responsibility for claims
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
13. Multiple-licensed code
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".
"Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions
of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if
any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
